      I am a Software Engineering student studying at the University of Alberta with a passion for full-stack development and deep learning. 
      I have a strong understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies, and I am super excited to put my skills to use in a professional setting. 
      I am constantly improving my skills by working on new projects to enhance my abilities in my free time. Some things I enjoy 
      indulging in my free time are working out, playing video games with friends or watching the latest shows/movies.
      Currently, I am seeking a summer internship for 2024. Can't wait to connect with you!
